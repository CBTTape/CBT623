AutoIPL Package Installation
============================

Please follow following procedures to install the AUTOIPL package

1. Upload the package
   The package is in TSO XMIT format, allocat a sequential data set
  (SYS1.AUTOIPL.XMIT) with following attributes:

  LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3120,SPACE=(TRK,(15,15))

2. Upload the package
   Upload the package via FTP or 3270 PC file transfer with BINARY
   mode.

3. Extract the package
   Issue following TSO command to extract the package:

   RECEIVE INDSN('SYS1.AUTOIPL.XMIT')
   DATASET('SYS1.AUTOIPL.INSTALL')

   The output data set SYS1.AUTOIPL.INSTALL is a PDS library contains
   all source to install the package.

4. Allocate Libraries.
   The package need following PDS libraries, you may use existing
   PDS libraries in your installation:
   a. LOADLIB. The load module will be saved to, this libary must
               me APF authorized, and in LINKLST in your
               SYS1.PARMLIB(PROGxx).

   b. PROCLIB. The authorized procedure library of your installation.
               such as SYS1.PROCLIB.

   c. PARMLIB. The parameters to be saved to, you may use SYS1.PARMLIB.

   d. REXXLIB. The rexx program be saved to, you may use SYS1.CLIST.

   In our installation example, we use following names:
   LOADLIB=SYS1.USER.LINKLIB
   PROCLIB=SYS1.USER.PROCLIB
   PARMLIB=SYS1.USER.PARMLIB
   REXXLIB=SYS1.USER.REXXLIB

5. Build load modules.
   Edit the member COMPILE and change the job card, LOADLIB, SRCLIB,
   and submit the job.
   The required load modules will be generated in your LOADLIB.

6. Copy the REXX programs.
   There is one REXX program named AUTOIPL.

   You can copy this program to your REXXLIB specified in Step 4.

7. Copy the Procedures.
   There are two started task procedures need to be copied to your
   authorized procedure library:
   IPLCMDS       Started Task to IPL system.
   SHUTDOWN      Started task to shutdown the system.

   You need to update the PARMLIB and REXXLIB to your installation
   requirements in step 4.

   You may also need to customize the system level started tasks
   in these procedures.

8. Copy the parameters.
   There are 4 parameter members in our installation libraries.
   They are examples for you to edit to meet your installation require-
   ments.
   IPLPROD       Parameter member to IPL the production system
   IPLTEST       Parameter member to IPL the test system
   SHUTPROD      Parameter member to shutdown the production system
   SHUTTEST      Parameter member to shutdown the test system

   Copy these members to your parmlib and edit them.
   Please refer @USERGDE to learn how to customize these members.

9. Security Setup.
   You need to assign a user for these two started tasks in step 6.
   You can setup a generic start task user, i.e. STCUSR, as RACF
   commands:

   ADDUSER STCUSR OWNER(SYS1) DFLTGRP(STCGRP) NAME('GENERIC USER')
   CONNECT STCUSR GROUP(STCGRP) OWNER(SYS1) UACC(READ)
   RDEFINE STARTED IPL*.* STDATA(USER(STCUSR) GROUP(STCGRP) +
           TRUSTED(YES) PRIVILEGED(NO) TRACE(NO))"
   RDEFINE STARTED SHUT*.* STDATA(USER(STCUSR) GROUP(STCGRP) +
           TRUSTED(YES) PRIVILEGED(NO) TRACE(NO))"

   This started user must have TSO CONSOLE authority. You can grant it
   via following RACF command:

   PERMIT MVS.MCSOPER.* CLASS(OPERCMDS) ID(STCGRP) ACCESS(USE)

   Started user should have OPERTATION authority to perform normal
   sysem operation.

10. Customize JES2 Parameters
   At IPL time, the procedure IPLCMDS can be started automatically
   when you put it at the end of JES2 parameters as following statements

   /* Start TSO and all other software. */
   $VS,'S IPLCMDS,SYSTEM=xxxx'

   Here xxxx is TEST or PROD.

   You may also put this command in SYS1.PARMLIB(COMMANDxx), and you
   should increase the wait time in IPLCMDS procedure.

11. Customize APF and LINKLST in PROGxx
   If you create a new LOADLIB to store AUTOIPL load modules. You must
   add this library into your APF authorized library list and your
   LINKLST. To do so, you need to change your SYS1.PARMLIB(PROGxx)
   to add this LOADLIB.
   Here are the sample statements to add SYS1.USER.LINKLIB:

   APF ADD DSNAME(SYS1.USER.LINKLIB)
   LNKLST ADD NAME(LNKLST30) DSN(SYS1.USER.LINKLIB)

12. Refresh the LINKLST and APF List
   You need to update the LLA and APF list.
   a. If you create a new LOADLIB for AUTOIPL modules, do following:
      Change the LINKLST name in PROGxx via ISPF change command:
          C NAME(LNKLST30) NAME(LNKLST31) ALL

      Update the LINKLIST dynamically:
         SET PROG=xx
      here xx is your suffix of your running PROGxx.

   b. Refresh LLA for load modules created in Step 5.
      Issue following MVS command:
         F LLA,REFRESH

13. Test AUTOIPL package.
   You should test this package in your test system before you
   put it into your production.

   a. Shutdown the system:
      Issue following command from console, or SDSF LOG:
          S SHUTDOWN,SYSTEM=TEST
      If you issue this command from SDSF LOG, log off your TSO session.
      All the tasks should be terminated and you should be able to
      see following hilighted message:

      'TEST SYSTEM SHUTDOWN IS COMPLETED,'
      ' IT IS SAFE TO POWER OFF OR RE-IPL &SYSTEM SYSTEM NOW.'

   b. IPL the system
      After you IPL the system, the AUTOIPL should start all tasks
      except those in SYS1.PARMLIB(COMMANDxx). You should be able to
      see following hilighted message:

      'IPL IS COMPLETED, TSO USERS MAY LOGON NOW.'
