Hi Sam,

I have designed a package named AUTOIPL, to automate system IPL
and shutdown procedure.  This package is running on our production
systems for a while.  I would like to share this package on
CBTTAPE.

Here are the features of this package:
1. Support automatic shutdown procedure.
    . Single command (S SHUTDOWN) will bring the system down and
ready to re-IPL or power off.
    . The shutdown can be in proper sequence to ensure the
integrity.
    . Validate the running tasks to avoid shutting down system by
mistake.
2. Support automatic IPL procedure. The IPL procedure
    . No system command is required to IPL system.
3. Support some system tasks automation. Such as restart tasks,
update system parameters.
4. Reply system messages by keywords, not by id.
5. Support WTO messages and highlighted WTO messages.
6. Provide option file to control shutdown and IPL sequence.

Here are the package in XMIT format.
<<AUTOIPL.XMI>>
Here are the installation guide and user guide (copied from XMIT
package):

<<AUTOIPL.USERGDE.TXT>>

Best Regards!
